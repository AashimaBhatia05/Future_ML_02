# ðŸŽµ Spotify Churn Prediction System

This project is an **end-to-end churn prediction system** that uses **Machine Learning**, a **Streamlit UI**, and a **Power BI Dashboard** to analyze user behavior and predict whether a Spotify user is likely to churn.  
It was developed as part of an **internship task**, showcasing the integration of data science, visualization, and user interaction.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict user churn on Spotify based on demographic and usage patterns.
- **Model:** XGBoost classifier trained on balanced data.
- **UI:** Interactive Streamlit web app for real-time churn prediction.
- **Dashboard:** Power BI dashboard for churn analytics and business insights.
- **Internship:** Completed as a practical task to apply ML & visualization skills in a real-world scenario.
